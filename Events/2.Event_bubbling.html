<!-- JavaScript events propagate in two phases:

Capturing Phase: Event travels from the root to the target element.
Target Phase: The event reaches the target element where it was triggered.
Bubbling Phase: Event travels from the target element back to the root. -->


<!-- Event bubbling 
Event Bubbling is the default behavior in the DOM, where an event starts at the 
target element and "bubbles up" through its parent elements in the DOM hierarchy 
during the bubbling phase. -->

<!-- to stop the bublling we are using event.stopPropagation -->
