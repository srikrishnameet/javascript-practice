//The forEach() method in JavaScript is an array method that executes a provided callback function once 
// for each element in the array. It’s designed for iteration, allowing you to perform an action on 
// every element without explicitly managing a loop counter. Unlike map(), filter(), or reduce(), 
// forEach() doesn’t return a new array or value—it’s purely for side effects
//  (e.g., logging, modifying external variables, or updating the original array).
